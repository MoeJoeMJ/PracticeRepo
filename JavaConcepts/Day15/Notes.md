# SERIALIZATION
- SerialVersionUID should be explicitly defined because wonâ€™t be able to deserialize our class because UID generated by java compiler for modified class will be different from old serialized object.
- Compatible Changes
    - Adding fields
    - Adding or removing writeObject() and readObject() methods
    - Changing access modifier
    - Static -> non-static and transient -> non-transient (it's like adding fields)
- Incompatible Changes
    - Deletion of fields
    - Non-static -> static and non-transient -> transient (it's like deletion fields)
    - Modifying writeObject() and readObject()
- Alternative ways to transfer objects over network
    - JSON - Stringifies an object
    - Hibernate - persisting objects in database and later can read that persisted object
    - XML - Object to network and transfer over network
- If any of the member does not implement Serializable than  NotSerializableException is thrown (MyClass myClass;)
- List, Set and Map would work though
- if superclass has implemented Serializable - constructor is not called during Deserialization process.
- if superclass has not implemented Serializable - constructor is called during Deserialization process.


# CONCURRENCY
- Synchronization methods 
    - making a method synchronized has two effects
        - When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object suspend execution until the first thread is done with the object.
        - when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object
## Happens-before relationship
- Set of rules that define the basis for reordering of instructions by a compiler or CPU
- When a thread enters a synchronization block, the thread will refresh the values of all variables that are visible to the thread at that time from the main memory.
- When a thread exits a synchronization block, the values of all those variables will be written to the main memory.
