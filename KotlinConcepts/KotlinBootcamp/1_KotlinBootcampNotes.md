# Kotlin Bootcamp

- In Kotlin almost everything has a value, even if that value is unit.
  Everything in Kotlin is an expression.
- exceptions are for and while loop, theyâ€™re statements.
- Because Default parameters are evaluated at call time by Kotlin
- The difference between EAGER and LAZY
  AN EAGER algorithm executes immediately and returns a result.
  A LAZY algorithm defers computation until it is necessary to execute and then produces a result.
- By default, filter analyst is EAGER that means every time you call filter, it creates a new list with he elements that pass through the filter
- If you want **LAZY** Behaviour, you can use SEQUENCES
- In kotlin everything is public by default
- Just use one primary constructor, constructor overloading is not needed as we can have default parameters with optional values.
- So just use one constructor with init blocks, if needed more flexibility consider adding helper methods
- All classes implicitly extend Any
- Any has three methods: equals(), hashCode() and toString()
- INTERFACE **DELEGATION** let's you add features to a class via composition
  Composition is when you use an instance of another class as opposed to inheriting from it
- **Decomposition** `val (x,y,z) = xyzDataClass` stores properties of class separately in values
- **Sealed** class - a class that can be sub-classed but only inside the file which it's declared
- Constants are top level and and works only in object classes, not in regular classes. To define constant in the class, you have to wrap them into a **companion object**. `companion object {}`
